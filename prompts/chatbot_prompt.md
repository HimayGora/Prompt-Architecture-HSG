Generic, slightly robotic feel to it. The enthusiasm feels a bit forced, and the phrasing is a little too direct and sterile for a "friendly, clear, and reassuring" tone.

output:
Updating your billing information is easy!  You can find the billing section within your account settings; just look for the "Billing" or "Payment Methods" tab.  Rest assured, this process is completely secure and your information is protected.
